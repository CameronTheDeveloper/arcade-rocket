# arcade-rocket

This Unity project is a 2D arcade game with C# scripts in which the user controls a rocket while bombs are falling from the sky. If the rocket hits a bomb, the game ends. 

This game includes a start game and a game over UI. The game starts after the user presses a key which will remove the start screen. Subsequently the bombs clone and start falling from the sky. I implemented a score that increments for each bomb that falls to the bottom and gets removed. A high score is created and overwritten by the current score when exceeded.

I created animations in Unity that appear in the game under various conditions. Animations include bomb explosion, rocket explosion, and rocket turn. The background and clouds moves downward creating a visual affect that the rocket is moving up.

I implemented particles using the Unity Particle System for the rocket's smoke and fire trail. There are also particles that appear when an explosion occurs.

The Unity package containing my complete project is on Master branch.
